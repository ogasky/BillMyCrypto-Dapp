# Detailed Description:
BillMyCrypto-Dapp is a decentralized application (dApp) that enables users to pay bills or send general payments using stablecoins like USDC and DAI on the Polygon Mainnet. It supports both direct wallet-to-wallet transfers and biller settlements (e.g., Airtel, MTN) with offline/manual NGN processing. Built with React, Tailwind CSS, Vite, and ethers.js, the project delivers a smooth and user-friendly experience.

The codebase was developed with the support of AI tools like ChatGPT and Grok, and future versions will integrate AI-powered services and assistants to enhance user support, guidance, and automation within the dApp.
